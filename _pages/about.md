Interests
======

Metabolism
------
Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions that are necessary for life. I am broadly interesed in the mechanisms by which cells determine nutrient levels and 
subsequently act upon this information. I am also interested in how metabolism is altered in disease.

Stress Responses
------
Cells have evolved mechanisms to alleviate various types of stress, including metabolic, protein, and DNA damage. These responses are critical for the tumorigenesis.
I am interested in how cells regulate these stress responses, the impact of these responses to the development of tumors, and the role of these responses in the 
tumor microenvironment.

Gene Regulation
------
Gene expression is controlled at many different levels, from chromatin confirmation and modifications to levels of transcription factors to signaling pathways. I am interested
in how this process is influenced by metabolism, environmental factors, and stress in healthy and disease states.
