*Metabolism*

Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions that are necessary for life. I am broadly interesed in the mechanisms by which cell's determine nutrient levels and subsequently act upon this information. 
This includes reprogramming of metabolism in order to compensate for deficiencies that arise, in normal physiology and in disease.

*Stress Responses*

Cells have evolved mechanisms to alleviate various types of stress.

*Genetics*
